    h1. On a glance:

    In the last years I've worked with both big and small teams on web application projects and infrastructure. As I came from the administration side, it was naturally for me to do the backend work, although I'm familiar with frontend technologies, too. I would say I'm a advanced programmer and an intermediate administrator.
    In coding, I'm aiming for stable, clear and forward looking results. I've seen a lot of things working and failing over the years and adapt this knowledge in my daily business. I'm eager to learn new technologies and thoughts and I'm proud of my fast learning skills.

    I'm also an open and supportive person. Though my political work I'm expirienced with group processes and my background knowledge help me to support diversity and cooperation.

    Currently I am employed as Backend Developer at Dawanda GmbH.
