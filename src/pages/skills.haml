    h1. On a glance:

    In the last years I've worked with small teams on web projects. As I came from the administration side, it was naturally for me to do the backend work, although I'm familiar with frontend technologies, too. I would say I'm a intermediate to upper intermediate programmer and an advanced administrator. I'm eager to learn new technologies and thoughts and I'm proud of my fast learning skills.

    Currently I am employed as software engineer at castaclip GmbH in Potsdam.

    h1. A short overview over my last projects

    h2. artflakes.com

    artflakes.com is a print-on-demand online shop with attached social networking features operated by myGall GmbH in Berlin. I was responsible for backend development and business-feature integration like vouchers, stickers and integration of
    social networking platforms. The site is based on Ruby-on-Rails, but it relies on node.js services for separated functions.

    h2. amicron_web

    A product of the Amicron GmbH, thought to be a web-interface for their invoice-managment software. I came to the project after it was run by two students over 2 years. Implemented a big featureset and build a spec-suite to steady the code before the project got frozen.

    h2. technoload.com

    I came to the project as a sub-contractor of weXelwirken. technoload.com was a online shop for various digital goods. I've implemented the main parts of it's functionalitzÂ´y of the php side (Upload, Processing and Representation). Afterwards I became a contractor of the customer himself. I've redesigned and relaunched it in Ruby on Rails and implemented an additional featureset the customer wanted.
